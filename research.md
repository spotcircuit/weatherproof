Construction Weather Risk & Insurance Research
Geographic Focus: United States First
The United States offers the best initial market due to standardized insurance processes and abundant free
weather data. NOAA’s climate databases are widely accepted for validating claims nationwide , and the
U.S. construction insurance sector is enormous (valued in the billions annually ). The U.S. also
experiences diverse weather patterns (e.g. Gulf hurricanes, Northern blizzards, Western wildfires), creating
a broad use-case for weather delay documentation. Starting in the U.S. allows leveraging ACORD industry
standards and focusing on major insurers (Travelers, Liberty Mutual, The Hartford, CNA, Zurich are among
the top construction insurers ). We can then expand to Canada (similar legal systems and weather),
followed by the UK and Australia once the model is proven. These countries have comparable insurance
frameworks and would benefit from lessons learned in the U.S. market.
Business Size Focus: Small to Mid-Sized Contractors
Target SMBs (10–100 employees, $1–50M revenue): These smaller construction firms have real insurance
needs but typically lack sophisticated in-house software. They are more inclined to adopt SaaS solutions and
can decide faster on new tools than enterprises. A subscription in the ~$50–$300/month range would fit
SMB budgets. In contrast, large enterprises often already use platforms like Procore, Oracle or SAP (which
may include weather modules) and have long sales cycles (6–18 months) with demands for customization.
Thus, focusing on SMBs provides a faster path to product-market fit and revenue. We can always pursue
enterprise partnerships later (e.g. offering white-label modules to big players), but initially SMBs offer quicker
adoption. Notably, the majority of smaller contractors still rely on manual methods – in one industry survey,
39% of construction firms were using spreadsheets and emailed documents for key processes . This
indicates a clear opportunity to provide an affordable, out-of-the-box weather claims/documentation tool
for these underserved SMB contractors.
Key Research Areas to Prioritize
1. U.S. Insurance Standards & Requirements
Understanding insurance claim standards is critical. Most major U.S. carriers adhere to ACORD forms –
standardized insurance documents used across insurers for claims, applications, etc. . We should
design reports to map to ACORD formats so they’re instantly familiar and acceptable. Also, we must account
for state-specific rules: for example, Florida law requires insurers to acknowledge a claim within 14 days
and pay or deny within 90 days , and Texas gives 15 days to respond and another 15 days to decide once
info is complete. Some states have unique policy forms or deductibles (Florida often has separate hurricane
deductibles, Texas has windstorm pools, etc.). Deductible structures for weather-related claims in
commercial policies tend to be high – often 1–5% of insured value, which for a $500K property means the
owner pays the first $25K . Many policies allow buy-down options to reduce wind/hail deductibles (e.g.
buying back from $25K to $5K) . Our product should clearly document deductibles and how they apply to

the claim. Focusing on the top insurers (e.g. Travelers, Liberty, The Hartford, CNA, Zurich) is wise, as these
five consistently rank among the leading construction insurance providers . Each may have preferred
evidence formats, but all will expect timely, well-documented claims. Ensuring our reports include all
ACORD-standard fields and any state-required notices will smooth acceptance. In summary, aligning with
U.S. insurance norms (forms, timelines, deductible handling, etc.) will make claims generated by our system
“plug-and-play” for adjusters.
2. SMB Construction Software Ecosystem
To drive adoption, our solution should integrate with the tools SMB contractors already use. Key platforms
to research include:
ServiceTitan (trades contracting): A dominant field-service management platform used by over
7,500 contracting businesses (reportedly ~97% market share in that category ). Many HVAC,
plumbing, and electrical contractors run their scheduling and jobs through ServiceTitan. It offers an
API for partners and has a large user base we can tap.
Buildertrend (home builders/remodelers): A leading project management SaaS with over 1 million
users across 100+ countries . Small home builders and remodelers rely on Buildertrend for
scheduling, selections, etc. An integration or at least data import from Buildertrend could be
valuable.
JobNimbus / AccuLynx (roofing contractors): Popular CRM/project tools in the roofing industry,
each used by thousands of roofing companies. Roofers are extremely weather-sensitive (roof work
halts in rain or high winds), so linking our weather-delay documentation with JobNimbus or
AccuLynx job records would be a strong use case. These platforms are often compared and widely
adopted among small to mid-size roofing firms .
QuickBooks (accounting): Virtually ubiquitous among SMBs. Almost all small business owners and
their accountants use QuickBooks for bookkeeping . At a minimum, our app should export
reports (e.g. cost of delays) in formats that can plug into QuickBooks. Even better, use the
QuickBooks API to push expense entries or attach claim payouts to the ledger. QuickBooks also has
an ecosystem of 750+ connected business apps , indicating we’d join a well-trodden integration
path.
Housecall Pro (smaller contractors in various trades): An all-in-one app for home services used by
45,000+ businesses (plumbers, cleaners, etc.) . Housecall Pro’s large base of very small
companies (1–10 employee range) suggests an opportunity – these users might not have any
solution for documenting delays. Even something simple like emailing our weather reports into
Housecall Pro, or parsing their job schedules, could add value.
Researching each tool’s popularity and integration capabilities is important. The good news: all of these
have either open APIs or at least export options. For example, ServiceTitan offers a developer API portal for
external integrations , and QuickBooks Online’s API is well-documented by Intuit for third-party apps
. By prioritizing CSV import/export (the universal format) and a few strategic APIs (QuickBooks for
financials, ServiceTitan for job info), we cover a large chunk of our SMB market. Additionally, leveraging
Zapier (5,000+ app connections) provides a “catch-all” integration method for users of more niche apps
– our app could connect to Zapier so contractors can automate data flow to whatever system they use.
Given that ~46% of small specialty contractors still use mostly manual systems , even basic
integrations like email parsing (e.g. auto-reading weather alerts or schedules from emails) could bridge the
gap for the least tech-savvy clients.

3. Integration Priorities and Workflow
Immediate integration wins:
1. CSV Import/Export: Every system can handle CSVs. We will allow users to import project schedules or
employee timesheets via CSV and export our weather impact logs in CSV. This ensures universal
compatibility.
2. QuickBooks API: As mentioned, QuickBooks is foundational. Using the QuickBooks API, our app can post
delay costs as line items or invoices directly. This saves the user from double-entry of financial data and ties
the claim to their accounting. QuickBooks integration is a common demand for any SMB software.
3. ServiceTitan API: ServiceTitan is the largest platform in the service contracting space. If we integrate, for
example pulling scheduled jobs and addresses and automatically checking weather forecasts for those job
sites, we could deliver daily “weather risk” alerts to ServiceTitan users. ServiceTitan’s API allows reading and
writing data (with OAuth authentication) , meaning we could even create a “Weather Delay” event inside
a job’s timeline via API. Given ServiceTitan’s market share and focus on trades that do get weather delays
(roofers, etc.), this is a high priority.
4. Zapier: Instead of building dozens of direct integrations, by integrating with Zapier we instantly become
connectable to thousands of apps. Zapier officially supports 5,000+ apps now , so a contractor could, for
example, connect our weather-delay report to their project management tool or Slack via Zapier. This
approach greatly extends our reach with minimal development.
5. Email and PDF parsing: Many smaller contractors simply communicate via email – for instance, a roofing
subcontractor might email a general contractor that “rain stopped work at 2pm, attached photos.” Our
system can ingest such emails (or allow forwarding them to a unique address) and parse out the key info.
Likewise, parsing PDFs (e.g. a weather report PDF from NOAA or a scanned crew timesheet) could automate
data entry. While not as neat as an API, this accommodates the large share of contractors still reliant on
emails and paper . Using OCR and text extraction, we can support those who aren’t on any major
platform.
In summary, the integration research indicates we should meet users where they are: provide simple
import/export for the spreadsheet/email crowd, deep integrations for the most-used SMB apps, and a
Zapier connector to cover everything in between. This will make our product fit into existing workflows
seamlessly.
4. Critical Documentation Features for Insurance Claims
To ensure insurance carriers accept and trust our reports, we must include certain documentation elements
that are considered “must-haves” in weather-related claims:
Official Weather Data (NOAA): Our reports should incorporate certified NOAA/National Weather
Service data for the incident. Insurers often demand third-party proof of the weather event. In fact,
contract specifications commonly require using the nearest NOAA weather station data to support
any time extension claim . Our system can automatically pull data from NOAA (which is freely
available) for the station closest to the project site, and include the distance to that station to
establish relevance. NOAA data is high-quality and widely used by insurers to validate claims ,
so this lends credibility. If NOAA is unavailable, we should allow alternative certified sources (e.g.
local airport meteorological data or private weather services approved by the insurer).
Timestamps and Timezone: Precision in timing is crucial. We will timestamp all weather events and
delays to the minute, including the local timezone. This avoids confusion especially for multi-state
20

companies. For example, stating “Work stopped at 2:30 PM CST on 10/12/2025 due to lightning”
leaves no ambiguity. It’s also helpful if a claim spans daylight savings changes or if an insurer in
another zone is reviewing.
Itemized Cost Calculations: Insurance adjusters expect detailed breakdowns of any cost being
claimed. Our tool should break out costs of delays in terms of labor, equipment, materials, etc. For
instance, if a concrete pour was delayed, we’d document the crew’s idle hours (labor cost),
equipment standby (equipment rental cost), and any wasted materials. This aligns with how claims
are evaluated – each component can be verified against rates. The goal is to provide a clear audit
trail of how the total claim amount is calculated, increasing trust in our documentation.
Photographic Evidence (with EXIF data): Photographs of site conditions or damage can hugely
strengthen a weather claim. We will enable attaching photos (e.g. of flooding, hail damage, muddy
site preventing work). Importantly, our system should capture or preserve the EXIF metadata in
these images – the embedded timestamp, date, and GPS coordinates. This data is essential to certify
when and where a photo was taken . Insurance investigators increasingly check photo metadata
to detect fraud or incorrect timing . By including EXIF info (or at least listing the photo
timestamp/location in our report), we add credibility. For example, a photo’s metadata might show it
was taken at the jobsite at 5:07 PM on the date of the delay, corroborating the timeline.
Digital Signatures & Affidavits: Many insurers require a signed Proof of Loss or affidavit as part of
the claim process. This is typically a sworn statement verifying the claim’s accuracy . Our platform
should allow authorized persons (e.g. the project manager or company owner) to digitally sign the
delay report or a generated proof-of-loss form. The signature should carry legal affirmations (we can
mirror the wording from standard proof-of-loss forms, which are often notarized statements of truth
). Capturing a digital signature (and possibly providing a notarization option via an
integration) will streamline what is otherwise a paperwork hurdle. Essentially, the output from our
system could serve as the affidavit if properly signed, saving the user from separate paperwork.
Beyond these must-haves, a few “bonus” documentation features could greatly enhance the value of our
reports and support broader needs:
OSHA Compliance Logs: If work was stopped for safety (e.g. lightning within 5 miles, high winds
halting crane lifts), our system can log it as an OSHA-related safety stop. OSHA regulations prohibit
certain work in storms or high winds (e.g. scaffold work, crane operation, etc.) . Documenting these
events not only justifies the delay to the owner/insurer but also demonstrates the contractor acted
responsibly. This could be useful if an insurer questions a delay – we show it wasn’t just preference
but a legal safety requirement.
Subcontractor Delay Notices: Often general contractors need to formally notify owners or subs of
delays. Our tool could auto-generate notice letters/emails when a weather delay occurs, complete
with the relevant contract clause citation. Keeping a log of these notices within the claim file shows
proactive communication. It also helps if a sub tries to claim extra costs – we have proof they were
notified of the schedule impact (or vice versa, subs notifying the GC). This feature aligns with
standard contract administration practices.
Material Delivery and Logistics Delays: Weather often impacts deliveries (e.g. a truck carrying steel
gets stuck due to flooded roads). We should allow users to log when expected deliveries are delayed
or rescheduled due to weather. Including supplier notices or traffic/weather reports that prevented
delivery can bolster any schedule impact claim. It’s an often overlooked cost – crews may be idle
waiting for materials. Our documentation can connect the dots (e.g. “flatbed carrying roof trusses
could not depart supplier on 9/3 due to hurricane warnings, causing a 2-day project delay”).

Equipment Idle Time Tracking: Construction equipment sitting idle still costs money (rent or
depreciation). For instance, if a crane is on site but can’t operate for 3 days of high winds, that is a
direct cost to the project. Our system can track each piece of major equipment, flag days it couldn’t
operate due to weather, and calculate the cost. Industry data shows idle time can be a significant
portion of operating hours (equipment is idle ~30% of the time on average) . By quantifying
weather-caused idle time, we give insurers a tangible metric of loss. This also helps contractors
optimize – they might choose shorter rental periods or different logistics knowing our analysis.
Schedule Impact Analysis: We should automatically analyze whether a weather delay affected the
project’s critical path. Many claims (for time extensions or delay costs) will be denied if the work was
not on the critical path (i.e. it didn’t actually delay the overall project completion) . Our tool
can integrate with scheduling data (from P6, MS Project, Buildertrend, etc.) to identify if the delayed
activity was critical. If it was, our report can state “This weather event extended the project
completion by X days.” If not, we might categorize it as a non-critical delay (perhaps only entitling a
time extension but not costs). Providing this analysis upfront, with perhaps a before-and-after Gantt
chart snippet, will answer one of the first questions an insurer or owner will ask. It demonstrates a
sophisticated understanding of delay claims and could set us apart. (Many contractors fail to do this
analysis and get claims rejected for lack of proof of critical impact .)
Overall, these documentation features turn our report into a comprehensive claims package. By including
hard data, evidence, and analysis, we increase the likelihood of claims approval and reduce back-and-forth
questions. The research confirms that insurance companies value data and clarity – if our output provides
everything on a silver platter (weather data, photos, costs, signatures, analysis), it addresses the typical
reasons claims get held up (insufficient documentation, lack of proof, etc.) .
5. Unique Opportunities & Value-Add Features
Beyond automating documentation of past events, there are forward-looking opportunities that could
differentiate our product:
Predictive Weather Alerts for Projects: Using forecasting, we can alert contractors of potential
delays before they happen. For example, “70% chance of >1 inch of rain tomorrow – expect site work
delays.” This isn’t just a generic weather app – it would tie to project-specific thresholds (perhaps
based on that project’s weather sensitivity). Modern APIs and AI can provide hyper-local forecasts. In
fact, emerging solutions use AI agents to translate weather forecasts into actionable project insights
. Our system could notify a superintendent a day or two in advance to adjust schedules (e.g.
cover materials, reschedule concrete pour). By predicting weather impacts, we help clients mitigate
losses (which insurers would also appreciate). Perry Weather and others already offer jobsite
lightning alerts ; we could integrate such services or build our own rules engine. Ultimately, “an
ounce of prevention” – giving early warning – could save time and money, and positions our
platform as not just reactive but proactive.
Bid/Estimate Adjustments for Weather Risk: We can use historical data to inform the bid phase.
For instance, our app could tell a user, “In this project location, typical weather delays are 5% of the
project duration/cost on average.” Thus, the estimator could add, say, a 5% contingency to their bid
or schedule. Many experienced contractors do this intuitively, but our tool can make it data-driven.
For example, if building in Florida in summer, one could expect frequent afternoon thunderstorms;
our data might say “expect ~10 rain days in June” which the estimator turns into added costs or a
longer schedule. Home builders commonly include a 5–10% contingency in budgets ; we could
specifically attribute a portion of that to weather. This feature turns our accumulated weather

database into a planning asset, answering the question “How much should I budget for weather delays
in this region?” and giving our users an edge in both pricing and negotiating with owners (who may
be skeptical about weather contingencies until shown the data).
Crew and Resource Optimization: For contractors with multiple active projects, we can suggest
tactical reallocations based on weather. For example, if Site A is rained out today but Site B (20 miles
away) has clear weather, the system might prompt: “Consider moving Crew 2 from Site A to Site B to
make up lost productivity.” This kind of real-time agility can significantly reduce downtime. It
requires knowing what work is scheduled where (hence integration with project schedules) and
cross-referencing with micro-forecasts. AI-based schedulers are heading in this direction – adjusting
resource allocations on the fly using weather predictions . We could implement a simpler
version: a dashboard showing all projects and an indicator of weather risk level for each, so
managers can proactively shuffle crews in the morning. Even a 5–10% improvement in crew
utilization during bad weather can save thousands in labor costs. This is a unique selling point that
moves us beyond “claims” into operations optimization.
Insurance Company Partnerships: If our platform gains traction in documenting weather claims,
insurers might want to partner with us. For example, an insurance carrier could offer our software as
part of a package to their insured contractors – because well-documented claims make their job
easier too. Carriers might negotiate bulk deals or discounts for their clients who use our tool, or
even white-label it. There is precedent: AXA XL (a major insurer) has a “Construction Ecosystem”
partnering with tech solutions to help clients manage risk . Insurers appreciate anything that
reduces fraud and speeds up claims. Our data could also feed into insurers’ underwriting – if a
contractor demonstrates they manage weather risk well (using our system), maybe they earn better
premiums. We should research outreach to insurance innovation programs (many have venture
arms or tech partnerships) as a go-to-market channel. In summary, excelling in the insurance
documentation space could turn potential adversaries (insurers) into allies – a significant
opportunity for scaling through endorsements or co-marketing.
Each of these opportunities (predictive alerts, bid analytics, crew optimization, insurer partnerships) opens
new revenue streams and sticky value for our platform. The common theme is using data intelligently: not
just recording what happened, but learning and predicting to benefit all parties. Few competitors in the
construction software space focus on weather-specific features at this depth, so this could differentiate us.
Research Questions & Answers
Finally, we investigated specific research questions to validate assumptions and refine our strategy:
What percentage of weather-related insurance claims get denied, and why?
Answer: Only a small percentage of legitimate weather claims are fully denied, but it varies. Industry
data shows roughly 3–4% of wind or hail claims are denied on average (these claims tend to have
clear cause and timing). However, in states like Florida – with frequent hurricanes and a history of
fraud disputes – denial rates can reach ~10% . The most common reasons for denial are policy
exclusions (~33% of denied claims) – for example, the damage was due to an excluded peril like
flood or just normal wear and tear . Other frequent reasons include late claim filing (≈15% of
denials, when the insured waited too long and the insurer says proper investigation was hindered)
and insufficient documentation (~12% of denials) . In short, a vast majority of weather claims
are paid out, and those that aren’t usually fail because of coverage gaps or lack of proof rather than
the insurer arbitrarily saying no. This reinforces the importance of our documentation focus – by

6
ensuring thorough and timely proof, we help avoid those denial reasons (especially the
documentation-related 12%). It’s also worth noting that even when not denied outright, many claims
get partially underpaid due to deductibles or depreciation. Minor claims often fall below deductible,
effectively resulting in no payout (though not a “denial” per se). Our system can help users
calculate whether a claim is above their deductible to decide if filing is worth it.
What is the average processing time for an insurance claim to be resolved, by insurer?
Answer: On average, homeowners’ property claims currently take about 1 to 2 months from first
notice to final payment. According to J.D. Power’s 2025 claims study, the average cycle time from
filing a property claim to finishing repairs is 32.4 days, and from first notice of loss to final payment
is over 44 days – the longest it’s been since tracking began in 2008. This is partly due to recent
surges in catastrophic events straining adjusters. For catastrophic (CAT) event claims, the repair cycle
stretches slightly longer (around 34 days) . There is variation by insurer: top-ranked carriers like
Chubb tend to close claims faster (hence higher satisfaction scores), whereas some others might be
slower, but specific per-insurer averages are not public. However, legally in many states insurers
must adhere to certain timelines – e.g. in Texas an insurer must accept or reject a claim within 15
business days of receiving all info (or request an extension) . In practice, straightforward claims
(small hail damage, etc.) may be paid in a couple weeks, while complex ones (major hurricane losses,
or those requiring extensive investigation) can take several months. The key takeaway is that speed
is a pain point – an average of 4–6 weeks feels long to customers . Our product can help by
accelerating the information exchange: if we produce a fully substantiated claim file quickly, the
adjuster doesn’t have to spend extra days requesting documents, potentially shortening the cycle.
We can’t control insurer workflows, but we can eliminate delays on the contractor’s side. Frequent
communication is also critical – J.D. Power notes that proactive updates dramatically improve
satisfaction even if the timeline is long . Thus, we might include a progress tracker or template
communications to keep all parties in the loop.
Which weather data sources are considered pre-approved or credible by insurers?
Answer: The gold standard is NOAA/National Weather Service data. Data from NOAA is
government-sourced, certified, and readily accepted by insurers and courts for documenting
weather events . For example, NOAA’s Storm Events Database or local NOAA weather station
reports are commonly used to verify if abnormal weather occurred on a given date. Many contracts
explicitly require using the nearest NOAA station records for weather delay claims . Other
credible sources include airport weather stations (often part of NOAA’s network), USGS rain
gauges, and reputable third-party forensic weather companies (like WeatherFlow, Accuweather’s
forensic reports, etc.) if they provide certified reports. Some insurance policies or state regulations
might list approved data sources – typically any “official” source such as National Climatic Data
Center archives or state climatology offices. In the crop insurance realm, even NOAA satellite data is
used (e.g. NOAA hurricane wind extent data is used to trigger certain index insurance) . By and
large, sticking to NOAA/NWS is safest since it’s considered objective and authoritative. If needed, we
can supplement with on-site weather station data (if the contractor has a sensor on site) but
insurers may scrutinize that unless it’s calibrated. Thus, our plan to pull nearest NOAA station data
(with distance noted) covers this – for instance, “NOAA Station XYZ (5.2 miles from site) recorded 1.4
inches of rain on May 5, 2025” provides a solid backbone for the claim. Insurers also appreciate when
you provide a comparison to normals (NOAA provides historical averages). Showing that an event
was truly extraordinary (e.g. “10-year rain event”) can support claims of unanticipated delays.
Summarily, NOAA = pre-approved in almost all cases, and any other source should ideally be one

backed by NOAA or similarly credentialed. Our research did not find any insurer that has its own
weather data system they require; they typically rely on these public or third-party sources.
Do any insurers have APIs for filing or managing claims?
Answer: Yes, a few insurers (especially large commercial carriers and insurtech-oriented companies)
offer APIs for certain aspects of claims. For example, Travelers has a Developer Portal with a
Business Insurance Claim Reporting API that allows external customers or partners to submit
claim information programmatically . This API can intake claim details for commercial policies,
which suggests we could integrate to automatically file a weather claim on behalf of the user.
Similarly, some insurers have partner APIs for specific lines – AXA’s developer site hints at APIs for
claims and service integration , and Zurich has exposed APIs in certain markets for policy and
claim data (mostly for corporate clients). Many insurance companies also participate in ACORD XML
data exchange for claims, which isn’t a public REST API, but means they can electronically consume
claim data in ACORD format. On the consumer side, newer digital insurers like Lemonade or Next
Insurance often have modern APIs, though those are more for quoting/binding; claims APIs are still
not common publicly. However, the existence of Travelers’ claim API is a great sign – it’s designed so
that big clients (or software like ours) can send claims directly . In the property insurance space,
there are also third-party platforms (like Xactimate/XactAnalysis) that insurers use – those have APIs
or at least data upload interfaces. In summary, while not widespread, at least one top
construction insurer (Travelers) does provide a claims API, and others are likely to follow. We
should design our system with the ability to integrate into such APIs when available. In the near
term, even generating an ACORD XML file of the claim that can be emailed to an adjuster can semiautomate
their side. But as the industry digitizes, being ready to plug into carriers’ systems (via API
or EDI) will be a key differentiator. It’s a space to watch – perhaps pilot an integration with Travelers
or a forward-thinking insurer’s sandbox.
What’s the typical deductible vs. claim amount in weather claims?
Answer: In commercial construction policies, weather deductibles are often fairly high (to avoid
many small claims). A typical range for wind/hail deductibles is $5,000 to $25,000 for SMB-level
policies, sometimes expressed as 1–5% of insured value . For instance, a 5% wind deductible on a
$500k project is $25k out-of-pocket. On the other hand, average claim amounts depend on the
severity: for homeowner policies, State Farm data shows the average hail damage claim in 2020 was
around $12,000 . Many roof damage claims fall in this range. That means if a homeowner has
a $2,000 deductible, they might net ~$10k from a $12k loss. In a commercial context, claims can be
larger, but also deductibles larger. It’s not uncommon that after a moderate event, the loss is at or
below the deductible – e.g. a small roofing repair of $4k when the deductible is $5k yields no claim
payout (insurers note a lot of weather incidents end up closed without payment for this reason) .
For catastrophic losses (like a partial collapse or major hurricane damage on a project), claim
amounts can be huge, but then policies might impose percentage deductibles or special hurricane
deductibles (e.g. 2% of insured value). In general, the deductible is a significant fraction of
typical weather claims. A $10k deductible might cover 30-50% of many routine claims – effectively
the contractor/self-insured part. Our product should highlight this math: it can help users decide
whether to file a claim or just absorb the cost. We could include a feature to compare claim amount
vs deductible. Also, when documenting costs, we should separate out the deductible portion. Typical
deductible vs claim ratios: for moderate events maybe 20-30% of the loss goes unpaid (deductible +
depreciation). In hail claims, one source noted homeowners often still pay about 40–50% of the roof
replacement when they had high deductibles and depreciation taken out . So demonstrating the
4.

5.
7
54 55

56
8
value of thorough documentation – to maximize the claim above the deductible – is key. For
example, if our documentation finds $30k of delay costs when the contractor assumed only $20k,
that extra documented $10k might be the difference between not hitting the deductible versus
getting a payout. In summary, deductibles around $5k-$25k are common, and many weather claims
cluster in the low tens of thousands, making it crucial to capture every cost to exceed the deductible
threshold.
Which states experience the most frequent or costly weather delays in construction?
Answer: States with extreme or unpredictable weather tend to lead in construction delays. Florida is
notorious due to its long rainy season and hurricanes – afternoon thunderstorms can halt work
frequently, and hurricane season can bring multi-day shutdowns. It’s no surprise Florida has among
the highest weather-related insurance activity (and higher claim denial rates due to the volume of
hurricane claims) . Gulf Coast states like Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas also see a high number
of weather delays, from hurricanes, tropical storms, to severe thunderstorms. Texas in particular
gets a double whammy: Gulf Coast hurricanes in the east, and hail, tornadoes, and flash floods in
other parts. Texas regularly leads in disaster declarations and insured loss events, indicating many
projects face weather interruptions. Great Plains states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska have
lots of severe thunderstorms and tornado-related pauses (springtime especially). They also get
winter ice storms. Northern states with harsh winters – like Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana,
Alaska – have significant weather shutdown periods (projects often pause or slow in deep winter
due to snow, frozen ground, or subzero temps). For example, in Alaska or the upper Midwest, the
effective building season is shorter; crews lose days to blizzards or have to use winter construction
techniques (which are slower and costlier). Even mountain states (Colorado, etc.) get sudden snow
that can delay work at elevation. On the West Coast, weather delays are more seasonal – Pacific
Northwest (Washington, Oregon) has long stretches of rain that can muddy sites, though
contractors there are somewhat adapted to work in light rain. California sees delays from wildfires
(smoke or fire danger stopping outdoor work) and occasionally heavy rains or mudslides. According
to one analysis, construction projects in the U.S. and Canada lose about 2 to 5 days per month on
average to weather-related delays – but that average skews higher in the Gulf Coast and
northern winter states, and lower in arid states like Arizona. If we consider OSHA data on weatherrelated
fatalities as a proxy for exposure: farming (which is outdoor) is highest, but among
construction trades roofers and general construction workers account for a significant share of
lightning fatalities – Florida and Texas lead those statistics – reinforcing that those states see
lots of storms that catch workers. In summary, the Gulf Coast (FL, TX, LA) stands out for frequent
weather interruptions (hurricanes, storms), the Great Plains for severe storms, and the far north
for winter downtime. These are prime geographies to target for our solution, as the pain of weather
delays is most acute there.
What trades have the highest weather-related delay costs?
Answer: Trades that perform most of their work outdoors and are weather-sensitive will incur the
highest delay costs. Roofing is a prime example – roofers cannot work during rain, high winds,
lightning, or extreme temperatures. Even a brief shower can force a stoppage and covering of the
roof, losing hours of productivity. Roofing materials (shingles, membranes) need dry conditions to
install properly . So roofing contractors often see significant downtime in bad weather and may
have to pay for additional labor hours to dry in a roof or temporary protection, etc. In fact, roofing is
one of the most weather-dependent trades; it also shows up in safety stats (15% of work lightning
fatalities were roofers) . Concrete work (and masonry): pouring concrete is highly weather-

sensitive – rain can ruin a pour, temperatures below freezing can prevent curing, and extreme heat
can cause cracking issues. So concrete pours get delayed due to rain or cold frequently, causing
ripple effects in the schedule. A canceled pour means the crew and pump sit idle (costs add up), and
formwork rent extends. Earthwork and excavation: moving dirt is tough in mud or when the
ground is frozen. Sitework crews often can’t grade or excavate during or right after heavy rains (soil
instability) – these delays can be extensive until conditions improve. For example, civil contractors
might be idled for days if a site is flooded. Exterior trades: siding, painting, exterior plaster/stucco –
all need dry weather (and moderate temps) for proper application. Paint and coatings usually can’t
be applied in rain or if the substrate is wet; many paints also require temperatures above ~50°F. Thus
painters and coating contractors experience weather hold-ups. Steel erection and crane
operations: cranes have wind limits; steel erection can’t proceed in high winds for safety. So
ironworkers may sit idle on windy days. Also, if lightning is within a certain range, all crane and
elevated work stops (per OSHA) . Paving/asphalt is another – asphalt must be laid in
relatively warm and dry conditions. On the other hand, interior trades (drywall, electrical, finish
carpentry) once the building is dried-in are far less affected by outside weather (except extreme
events that halt the whole job). So the biggest weather delay costs belong to shell and site trades: site
prep, concrete, structural, exterior envelope, and roofing. These are often on the critical path early in
the project, so their delays disproportionately cause project-wide costs. Our tool should perhaps
have templates or specific guidance for these high-risk trades – e.g. a “roofing delay report” template
that captures unique aspects (like covering costs, overtime to dry-in) or a concrete pour log that
records weather suitability. In sum, roofing likely tops the list in sensitivity (a single rainstorm can
blow the day’s work), with concrete and earthwork closely following. By focusing on serving these
trades (or GCs managing these trades), we target those who stand to gain the most from weather
planning and documentation.
Conclusion: Centering on U.S. SMB contractors, our research confirms a strong need for a weather claims
and delay documentation solution. By incorporating industry standards (ACORD, NOAA data) and
integrating with tools SMBs use, we can streamline a $150+ billion problem space. The research answers
above reinforce that thorough documentation (timestamps, photos, cost breakdowns, critical path impact)
is essential to get claims approved – our product’s core value. Additionally, leveraging predictive analytics
and fostering insurance partnerships can elevate the offering from a reactive tool to a proactive risk
management platform. This focused approach on weather-related delays for construction SMBs offers a
clear path to product-market fit and a significant market opportunity, with relatively little direct competition
currently addressing these specific pain points.

ore Capabilities for a Construction Delay Documentation SaaS
1. User & Project Setup
Easy onboarding: Allow new users (contractors, PMs, subs) to sign up and set up a project in minutes.

Project profiles: Store project address, type, contract numbers, owner/GC info, and critical contract dates (start, completion, deadlines).

2. Weather Data Automation
Automated weather fetch: Pull official weather data for project address and date(s) in question (via NOAA API, OpenWeatherMap, etc.).

Attach as evidence: Auto-generate charts, reports, or simple weather summaries to attach to each delay report.

Historical look-back: Allow users to document delays retroactively with accurate weather pulled for any date.

3. Daily Log & Event Reporting
Mobile-friendly daily log: Users record work status, weather, manpower, delays (tap to add, voice-to-text, attach photos).

Incident/delay event creation: One-click to flag a “delay event” with cause (“rain,” “wind,” “extreme cold”), duration, work affected.

Photo/video evidence: Instantly attach site photos/videos via mobile/desktop.

4. Notice Generation
Auto-generate “Notice of Delay” forms: Fill in contractually required details, dates, reasons, and auto-draft compliant language (customizable for AIA, ConsensusDocs, custom forms).

Email/send to stakeholders: Built-in notifications—send PDF/email to GC, owner, architect, insurer, or export for upload to portals.

Track deadlines: Reminders for notification periods (e.g., “Notice must be sent within 48 hours of event”).

5. Insurance Documentation
Auto-fill insurance claim templates: Pre-populate standard fields (project, event, date, loss description).

Bundle supporting docs: Attach weather report, daily log, incident report, site photos, contract clause references.

Export to insurer-friendly formats: PDF, DOCX, email attachment, or direct API integration for larger carriers.

6. Legal & Contract Compliance
Template library: Support multiple form types—AIA, AGC, ConsensusDocs, custom company forms.

Auto-insert relevant contract clauses: Parse and embed force majeure/delay language if user uploads their contract.

Track/document compliance: Show a “compliance meter” so users know if all needed steps are documented for claims.

7. Reporting & Analytics
Dashboard: Show open, closed, pending delay events per project.

Export logs: Download CSV/PDF reports for internal or legal review.

Analytics: Track delay causes, days lost, and notice timeliness (for risk and performance review).

8. Integrations & Extras
Connect to major platforms: Simple integrations (via Zapier/API) with Procore, Buildertrend, email, Dropbox, Google Drive.

White-label options: Allow consultants or larger GCs to use their branding.

# WeatherProof Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: PDF Generation (PRIORITY)
**Why:** Can't submit claims without actual documents

### Tasks:
1. **Implement PDF generation library**
   - Use @react-pdf/renderer or puppeteer
   - Create PDF templates for:
     - Notice of Delay
     - Insurance Claim Form
     - Daily Weather Log
     - Monthly Summary Report

2. **Create Notice of Delay generator**
   ```typescript
   // Components needed:
   - /src/components/notice-generator.tsx
   - /src/services/pdf-templates/notice-of-delay.ts
   - /src/app/api/generate-notice/route.ts
   ```

3. **Bundle supporting documents**
   - Weather data attachment
   - Photo evidence
   - Crew/equipment impact summary

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

## Phase 2: Email & Notifications
**Why:** Required for timely stakeholder communication

### Tasks:
1. **Set up email service**
   - Integrate SendGrid or Resend
   - Create email templates
   - Track email delivery status

2. **Implement notification system**
   ```typescript
   // Features:
   - Send notice to multiple recipients
   - Track who opened/received
   - Store communication history
   ```

3. **Add deadline reminders**
   - Track contract notification periods
   - Send automated reminders
   - Dashboard alerts for pending notices

**Estimated Time:** 2 days

## Phase 3: Photo/Video Evidence
**Why:** Visual evidence strengthens claims

### Tasks:
1. **Implement file upload UI**
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Mobile camera integration
   - Progress indicators

2. **Storage integration**
   - Supabase storage buckets
   - Image optimization
   - Thumbnail generation

3. **Evidence gallery**
   - View photos by delay event
   - Add captions/timestamps
   - Include in PDF reports

**Estimated Time:** 2 days

## Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting
**Why:** Track patterns and improve operations

### Tasks:
1. **Build analytics dashboards**
   - Delay causes breakdown
   - Cost impact trends
   - Weather pattern analysis
   - Compliance tracking

2. **Export functionality**
   - CSV exports for Excel
   - PDF report generation
   - API for external tools

**Estimated Time:** 3 days

## Phase 5: Contract Compliance
**Why:** Ensure legal requirements are met

### Tasks:
1. **Template library**
   - AIA forms
   - ConsensusDocs
   - Custom templates

2. **Compliance tracking**
   - Visual compliance meter
   - Missing document alerts
   - Audit trail reports

**Estimated Time:** 2 days

## Phase 6: Mobile Experience
**Why:** Field teams need mobile access

### Tasks:
1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Offline capability
   - Push notifications
   - Camera integration

2. **Mobile-optimized flows**
   - Quick delay entry
   - Voice-to-text
   - One-tap photo upload

**Estimated Time:** 3 days

## Quick Wins (Can do immediately):
1. **Add "Export CSV" to delays list** - 1 hour
2. **Create simple text email alerts** - 2 hours
3. **Add photo upload to delay form** - 3 hours
4. **Basic PDF with current data** - 4 hours

## MVP for Insurance Claims:
Minimum needed to submit actual claims:
1. ✅ Capture delay data (DONE)
2. ✅ Track crew/equipment impact (DONE)
3. ✅ Weather verification (DONE)
4. ❌ Generate PDF notice (NEEDED)
5. ❌ Email to stakeholders (NEEDED)
6. ❌ Attach photos (NEEDED)

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Start with Phase 1** - PDF generation is critical
2. **Add basic email** - Even simple notifications help
3. **Photo upload** - Easy win that adds value
4. **Then iterate** - Build other features based on user feedback
